================  Kibuvits Ruby Library (KRL) Selftests  ==================
===========================================================================

All of the KRL testcase classes have a static method named "selftest".
The selftests are, by their nature, usually almost as thorough
demo code as it can get. The KRL code is aimed to be self-explanatory.

The ./ marks the folder that contains the COMMENTS.txt that
You are currently reading.

All of the "selftest" methods within the KRL can be
executed by executing

    ruby ./../run_all_kibuvits_selftests.rb

The test class names can be listed by executing:

    cd ../; ruby ./run_all_kibuvits_selftests.rb -l

Selftest of a single class can be run without running all of the
KRL selftests by giving the name of the class as the
first console argument. An example:

    ruby ./../run_all_kibuvits_selftests.rb Kibuvits_str_selftests

Usually a selftest class name starts with the name of the
class that it tests and has a suffix of "_selftests".
For example, a selftest class of the class Kibuvits_ProgFTE is
called Kibuvits_ProgFTE_selftests.
