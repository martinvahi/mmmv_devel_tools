=========================  KRL Deprecated code  ===========================
===========================================================================

A general design policy of the KRL is that backwards compatibility
is not maintained and if something is considered totally flawed, then 
it will be deleted.

However, sometimes some code is just suitable to be somewhat in a role 
of a museum artifact or it can ge used as an historical semi-blueprint
for writing newer code that has an updated, more modern, design.

The KRL deprecated_code_museum folder is for such museum artifacts.

The KRL deprecated_code_museum folder is omitted by 
the KRL selftests system.
