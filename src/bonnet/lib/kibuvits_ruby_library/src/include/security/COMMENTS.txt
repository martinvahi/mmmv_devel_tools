==================  A few Words About Security  ===========================
===========================================================================

In control applications, where cryptography is used
for keeping devices, robots, doors, etc.
under the control of their owners, it does not matter that
NSA/KGB/FSB/whatever has means for breaking the encryption
of the encrypted communication.

It is good enough, if it takes them at least 3 years to break it,
because 2 years should be enough for replacing the keys
of the appliances.

What regards to the privacy of "simple citizens", then
Hitler's goons can always just march in, take, "tax", what ever
and shoot, imprison, anyone. Cryptography is a tool for
somewhat forcing the Hitler's goons to conduct their atrocities
at places/conditions that have been chosen by the "simple citizens".
