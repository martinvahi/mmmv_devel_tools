mmmv_crypt_t1 
===========================================================================

The mmmv_crypt_t1 is a set of 3 console tools that wrap some of the 
Kibuvits Ruby Library cryptography related code.

The tools display their command-line parameter syntax whenever they are
executed without any command-line parameters. Examples:

    mmmv_decrypt_t1
    mmmv_encrypt_t1
    mmmv_genkey_t1

Encrypted files are about 100x (hundred times) the size of their 
respective cleartext files.

The console tools are not backwards compatible, which means
that a copy of the tools must be distributed with the generated keys.
