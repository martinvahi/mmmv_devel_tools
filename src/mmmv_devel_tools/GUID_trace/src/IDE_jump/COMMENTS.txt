=============================  IDE_jump  =================================
==========================================================================

The scenario that the the IDE_jump is meant to be used in is that
different Integrated Development Environments have different
feature sets and at times one wants to edit the very same
source file with different IDE-s.

The IDE_jump project is a set of IDE_plugins, extensions, that
allow one to switch from one IDE to another so that the text cursor
does not change its position during the switch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Scenario Explained by an Example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) One edits file nice.js, line 69, column 42 in NetBeans.

2) After pushing a key-combination that has been assigned to a
   IDE_jump NetBeans plugin, an Alt-TAB key-combination
   analogue is executed and KomodoIDE is opened so that
   the text cursor resides in file nice.js, line 69, column 42.

3) In KomodoIDE one moves to file awsome.js, line 7, column 6 and
   presses a key-kombination that is assigned to a KomodoIDE extension.
   The Alt-TAB key-combination analogue is executed and the NetBeans
   IDE is brought to front, with text cursor residing in
   in file awsome.js, line7, column 6.

4) etc.

                    Usage and Installation HOW-TO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a Ruby (1.8.x) program called IDE_jump_server, which mediates
the jump commands that are sent to it from the plugins
of different IDEs.

The switching of the opened applications depends on a window manager
and currently only Linux with KDE is supported. However, the
IDE_jump_server is modular and new operating systems can be
added without modifying the IDE_jump_server code.  The adding of new
operating systems/window managers, is explained in
./src/IDE_jump_server/COMMENTS.txt .

Each of the currently supported IDEs has its own folder in the ./src
folder. The installation of the IDE plugins is explained in the
COMMENTS.txt that resides in the IDE's folder. It is not compulsory
to use all of the supported IDEs, but if one adds support for a
new IDE, one has to update ./src/IDE_jump_server/config.txt .
