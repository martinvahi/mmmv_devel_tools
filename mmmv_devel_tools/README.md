mmmv_devel_tools
===========================================================================

The mmmv_devel_tools is a collection of software development
utilities and IDE integration scripts.

The tools set depends on Ruby 2.x.x, rubygems, Bash, a set of
common Linux/BSD command line tools.  The mmmv_devel_tools is
Linux/BSD specific.

Almost all of the mmmv_devel_tools has been written by
the Martin.Vahi@softf1.com and is licensed under the BSD license:

##                            Setup

Some parts of the mmmv_devel_tools depend on the
environment variable

    MMMV_DEVEL_TOOLS_HOME

which is expected to point to to the folder that
contains the README.md that You are currently reading.

The environment variable, MMMV_DEVEL_TOOLS_HOME,
is useful in situations, where the
location of the mmmv_devel_tools home folder
can not be reliably derived from file paths
that are known within an operating system process.
For example, mmmv_devel_tools component, JumpGUID
runs JavaScript code within the process of

http://www.openkomodo.com/

and the only way to find the mmmv_devel_tools
installation folder in that script without
editing the script, nor editing/creating some
pre-hard-coded configuration file, is to ask
questions from operating system (or
something on the net, etc.).


The rest of the setup instructions reside in the

    $MMMV_DEVEL_TOOLS_HOME/src/etc/COMMENTS.txt

(and those are scary. 8)

##                      Remarks for Integrators

Projects that depend on mmmv_devel_tools, can interact with the
mmmv_devel_tools by its public API, which resides at

    $MMMV_DEVEL_TOOLS_HOME/src/api

Client programs have the option to interact with the tools
individually by executing the tools' bash based gate.

The

    $MMMV_DEVEL_TOOLS_HOME/src/api/COMMENTS.txt

describes the public API.

##                      Remarks for Newcomers

Officially the mmmv_devel_tools is not supported on Windows,
but some of its sub-projects (renessaator, UpGUID) might work
under Windows, if they are started in the CygWin(http://www.cygwin.com/ )
Bash environment and the CygWin has been installed to

    c:\cygwin

The current version of mmmv_devel_tools Eclipse IDE integration
does not work under windows, because the IDE_integration Ruby scripts
have not been updated. As of 2012 the JRuby that is used in
the Eclipse IDE scripting environment
(ScriptEclipse, http://www.viplugin.com/scripteclipse.htm , but
it is not a ScriptEclipse specific flaw) does not support full
set of Unicode characters.

A side note about the JRuby:

The probable reason, why the JRuby does not have
full Unicode support is the fact that Java (and hence the JVM)
supports Unicode by an after-birth-hack-on. The genuine Ruby
has support to multiple encoding formats, probably even the
TRON strings (http://www.ertl.jp/ITRON/SPEC/mitron4-e.html ),
by attaching string formatting information to every string instance.
