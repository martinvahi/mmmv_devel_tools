==================  mmmv_devel_tools Global TODO list  ====================
===========================================================================

Currently complete:
    renessaator, UpGUID, JumpGUID

Currently functional but need improvement:
    DumpGUID, breakdancemake

Next things to complete:

    *) Complete the JetBrains WebStorm PMIP based IDE-driver after
       instructions have appeared to
       http://code.google.com/p/pmip/issues/detail?id=13

    *) Write a Komodo IDE based source code
       bookmarks system, where bookmarks are based on
       file name and regular expression. The architecture
       would mimic that of the JumpGUID, i.e. it would have
       a Ruby based backend and the Komodo IDE front-end
       would be almost copy-pasted from JumpGUID, except that
       in addition to the Ruby based back-end and Komodo IDE
       JavaScript based plugin it would also have a PHP
       based web application where the server side
       communicates with the Ruby based back-end.


Semi-bugs:
    renessaator has a console argument, "--language", while
    the breakdancemake uses an environment variable, KIBUVITS_LANGUAGE
    One should refactor the renessaator to use only the
    environment variable, the KIBUVITS_LANGUAGE, and remove the
    "--language" console argument.

Low-priority but interesting:
    *) The primary show-stopper for running the mmmv_devel_tools
       on windows is the kibuvits_shell.rb. Secondary show-stopper
       is some windows specific branching crap at the kibuvits_io.rb.
       Best chances for success on Windows 7 seems to be with the cygwin
       version that comes with the Git Windows installer.

    *) ScriptEclipse(http://www.viplugin.com/scripteclipse.htm )
       based Eclipse IDE-driver for JumpGUID
