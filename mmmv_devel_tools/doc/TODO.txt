==================  mmmv_devel_tools Global TODO list  ====================
===========================================================================

Currently complete:
    renessaator, UpGUID, 

Currently functional but need improvement:
    JumpGUID, DumpGUID, breakdancemake,

Next things to complete:

    1)  Vim integration for the renessaator and UpGUID.
    3)  Eclipse IDE-driver for JumpGUID
    3a) Study, if it is possible to create a script-based 
        IDE-driver for the JetBrains WebStorm IDE.

Semi-bugs:
    renessaator has a console argument, "--language", while
    the breakdancemake uses an environment variable, KIBUVITS_LANGUAGE
    One should refactor the renessaator to use only the 
    environment variable, the KIBUVITS_LANGUAGE, and remove the 
    "--language" console argument.

Low-priority but interesting:
    The primary show-stopper for running the mmmv_devel_tools
    on windows is the kibuvits_shell.rb. Secondary show-stopper
    is some windows specific branching crap at the kibuvits_io.rb. 
    Best chances for success on Windows 7 seems to be with the cygwin 
    version that comes with the Git Windows installer.
