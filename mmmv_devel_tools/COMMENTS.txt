===========================================================================

The mmmv_devel_tools is a collection of software development
utilities and IDE integration scripts.

The tools set depends on Ruby 2.x.x, rubygems, Bash, a set of
common Linux/BSD command line tools.  The mmmv_devel_tools is
Linux/BSD specific.

Almost all of the mmmv_devel_tools has been written by
the Martin.Vahi@softf1.com and is licensed under the BSD license:

                              Setup
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mmmv_devel_tools depends on the following optional
environment variables:

MMMV_DEVEL_TOOLS_HOME  --- points to the folder that contains the
                           COMMENTS.txt that You are currently reading.
                           It is useful in situations, where the
                           location of the mmmv_devel_tools home folder
                           can not be reliably derived from file paths
                           that are known within an operating system process.

                           The environment variable, MMMV_DEVEL_TOOLS_HOME
                           is required in the following projects:

                               x) JumpGUID http://www.openkomodo.com/ driver.


The rest of the setup instructions reside in the

    $MMMV_DEVEL_TOOLS_HOME/src/etc/COMMENTS.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Projects that depend on mmmv_devel_tools, can interact with the
mmmv_devel_tools by its public API, which resides at

        $MMMV_DEVEL_TOOLS_HOME/src/api

and the client programs have the option to interact with the tools
individually by executing the tools' bash based gate.


The

        $MMMV_DEVEL_TOOLS_HOME/src/api/COMMENTS.txt

describes the public API.

                        Remarks for Newcomers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Officially the mmmv_devel_tools is not supported on Windows,
but some of its sub-projects (renessaator, UpGUID) might work
under Windows, if they are started in the CygWin(http://www.cygwin.com/ )
Bash environment and the CygWin has been installed to

    c:\cygwin

The current version of mmmv_devel_tools Eclipse IDE integration
does not work under windows, because the IDE_integration Ruby scripts
have not been updated. As of 2012 the JRuby that is used in
the Eclipse IDE scripting environment
(ScriptEclipse, http://www.viplugin.com/scripteclipse.htm , but
it is not a ScriptEclipse specific flaw) does not support full
set of Unicode characters.

A side note about the JRuby:

        The probable reason, why the JRuby does not have
        full Unicode support is the fact that Java (and hence the JVM)
        supports Unicode by a after-birth-hack-on. The genuine Ruby
        has support to multiple encoding formats, probably even the
        TRON strings (http://www.ertl.jp/ITRON/SPEC/mitron4-e.html ),
        by attaching string formatting information to every string instance.
