   Neither the prefixes nor the names of the variables
   imply that the variables do not hold the value of nil.

   Often the value of 42 is used as a "whatever whole number".
   That choice is purely for fun and has its influences from
   the names of projects like Scheme 84, Scheme 48, and the
   "Ultimate Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life,
   The Universe, and Everything".
