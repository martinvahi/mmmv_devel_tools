=======================  UpGUID, a GUID Updater ===========================
===========================================================================

In the context of the UpGUID the acronym "GUID" stands for
"Globally Unique Identifier".
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_Identifier

The only purpose of the UpGUID is to replace all of the
GUIS in a string with new ones and to do that as
a stand-alone console tool or as a back-end to extendable IDEs
that communicate with external filters by using the stdin and stdout.

Only GUIDs that are wrapped in single(') or double(") quotes are
replaced and that's a feature, not a bug.

The UpGUID is written in Ruby. It depends on the 
Kibuvits Ruby Library (hereafter: KRL) and uses the value of
the environment variable KIBUVITS_HOME, but if the KIBUVITS_HOME
is not defined or has an empty string as its value, then 
it uses the version of the KRL that ships with the UpGUID
distribution. 

The UpGUID runs with Ruby 2.0 or newer.

                               Usage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To update the file HotAndCool.fun without using
the stdin and stdout interface:

       upguid -f ./HotAndCool.fun

The following console line feeds the file HotAndCool.fun to the
UpGUID through the stdin and the UpGUID returns its output to the
stdout:

        upguid - < ./HotAndCool.fun

                       Drawbacks and Known Flaws
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current version is not able to replace GUIDs that
contain a line break. The support for such a feature
is planned never to exist because GUIDs are defined to
be without line breaks.
