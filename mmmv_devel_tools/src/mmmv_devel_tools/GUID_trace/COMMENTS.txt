In the context of the GUID_trace the acronym "GUID" stands for
"Globally Unique Identifier".

                          1. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GUID_trace is based on the idea that if a project source code,
regardless of programming language, contains unique strings,
for example, GUID-s, then it is possible to recursively search (grep) the
project source tree and have a text editor or an IDE open the
source file and display the exact row and column of the source file,
where the unique string, which could be a GUID, resides.

If GUiDs are part of exception messages, then it is possible
to use regular expressions to extract a stack of GUID-s
from a stack of exception messages. The stack of exception messages
might be an stderr output.

If there exists a stack of GUID-s, then it is possible to
script some IDE-s, for example, the KomodoEdit (www.opencomodo.com)
and the Eclipse (with the help of http://www.viplugin.com/scripteclipse/ ),
to move an imaginary cursor up and down the stack of GUID-s,
with a side effect that after every move the IDE opens exactly the
row of a source file, where the selected GUID resides.

This means that in stead of looking at the stderr or JavaScript
console stack trace and then opening the file "manually", one can
just hit a few key combinations that correspond to up or down
arrow keys and the IDE opens the row of the file that
contains the GUID.  For example, the benefit of an IDE over
web browser built-in JavaScript navigator is that
the IDE can edit the actual project sources, but
the web browser has only access to a copy of the JavaScript sources.

The GUID_trace toolset is applicable to any programming language that
supports exceptions and has a possibility to print/display at least one
exception message per run. The GUID_trace allows to debug JavaScript
libraries in somewhat web browser independent manner.

                           2. Controversy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

On 17 May 2013 I(martin.vahi@softf1.com) received 
very helpful feedback from Juhan-Peep Ernits
(https://www.etis.ee/portaal/isikuCV.aspx?PersonVID=38510&lang= ),
who figured out that the GUID-s can be replaced by the line number
and file path that the tools provide, except when the executable is
without debugging information or compressed.

As of May 2013 I agree with that observation, but I still prefer the 
code-cluttering GUID-s approach, because the GUID-s based
solution does not require any tool (web browser, interpreter,
debugger, etc.) specific code that retrieves the line number
and file path from the tool.  For example, if a web browser extension
were created, the extension would have to be updated as the web browsers
evolve. GUID-s based approach clutters up the code with extra strings,
but it does not require that kind of maintenance.

                           3. Dependencies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GUID_trace has been written in Ruby, version 2.0 or newer, and
the GUID_trace depends on Bash, grep, various other Linux command line
tools and the Kibuvits Ruby Library (hereafter: KRL).
The KRL is Linux specific, but sub-parts of it might work with cygwin.

Ruby related dependencies include projects like rubygems and rake.

The rest of the dependencies are optional and depend on IDE-s that
one wants to use. For example, in the case of the KomodoEdit there
are no additional dependencies, but in the case of the Eclipse, the
http://www.viplugin.com/scripteclipse/ is mandatory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           4. Setup
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GUID_trace uses settings from the mmmv_devel_tools settings system,
which is described at

    ./../../../src/etc/COMMENTS.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   5. Currently Published Components
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

UpGUID       --- The UpGUID is useful in a situations, where
                 code gets copy/pasted or code templates are used and
                 all GUIDs are required to be unique.

                 The UpGUID searches a string or a file for a GUID that is
                 surrounded by quotation marks and replaces
                 each of the GUIDs with a newly generated, unique, GUID.

                 The quotation marks can be either
                 single quotes (') or doublequotes ("), but a pair of them
                 must consist of only one kind of quotation marks.


JumpGUID     --- Scripts that allow IDE-s to navigate the stack of GUIDs
                 that is assembled from the stderr output.

                 JumpGUID core parses the stderr output string,
                 assembles the stack of GUIDs and implements the
                 book-keeping.

                 JumpGUID IDE drivers are the scripts that the IDEs load.

DumpGUID     --- Facilitates the transfer of stderr string to the JumpGUID.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDE_jump --- One day one might open a file at a specific
             location in one IDE and then have a second IDE display
             the same file at the same location by a keystroke.
