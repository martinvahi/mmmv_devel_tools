The grammar of this configurations file adheres to the 
specification of the Kibuvits_str.configstylestr_2_ht(...), 
which is part of the Kibuvits Ruby Library.

The main grammar rule is that parameters must be declared
only once and any line that is not part of a heredoc 
and does not contain an unescaped equals sign is a comment. 
An escaped equals sign looks like this: \=

The semantics of this configuration file is described in the ./COMMENTS.txt :-)
